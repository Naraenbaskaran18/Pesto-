## Overview

In this repository, you will find the artifacts and deliverables for the automated testing assignment focused on an E-commerce website. The assignment is divided into three parts: Test Planning, Test Case Design, and Test Automation. Each section is detailed below.

## Part 1: Test Planning

**<ins>Test Strategy Document</ins>**

The Test Strategy Document outlines the approach to testing the E-commerce website. It covers objectives, scope, testing levels, types, entry and exit criteria, test environment, tools, and risk analysis.

**<ins>Test Plan </ins>**

The Test Plan provides a detailed plan for executing the testing strategy. It covers test deliverables, schedule, resources, test data and environment setup, and test execution and reporting.

## Part 2: Test Case Design

**<ins>Functional Test Cases</ins>**

The Functional Test Cases document contains a set of test cases for key features such as user registration, product search, adding items to the cart, checkout process, and order management.

**<ins>Edge and Boundary Test Cases</ins>**

The Edge and Boundary Test Cases document includes test scenarios that evaluate the system's robustness by testing extreme ends of acceptable values.

## Part 3: Test Automation

**<ins>Test Automation Framework</ins>**

We have chosen Selenium as the test automation framework due to its versatility and wide support for web applications. An overview of the framework's architecture is available in the Test Automation Framework document.

**<ins>Automated Test Scripts</ins>**

The Automated Test Scripts directory contains automated test scripts implemented using Selenium for three critical scenarios outlined in the Functional Test Cases. Ensure that these tests cover both positive and negative cases.

**<ins>Test Data Management</ins>**

Methods for managing test data are detailed in the Test Data Management document.
